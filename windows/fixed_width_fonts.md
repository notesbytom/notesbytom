# Fixed Width Fonts

Fixed Width (Monospace) Fonts for use in Windows and Microsoft Office.

## Font Portability

Microsoft Word appears to revert to some default fonts silently (no error) when a Document is opened with Fonts missing from the system. The font-name is still associated with text and will be used on any system where the specified font is installed. I'm not sure if there is a way to generate an error when a font is not present?

Some monospaced fonts might be substituted with default variable-width fonts silently by MS Word.
