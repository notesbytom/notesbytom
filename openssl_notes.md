# OpenSSL Notes

## Using OpenSSL on Windows. 

One easy way is to install Git for Windows and access it through Git Bash.
* use `winpty` before openssl commands if they will prompt for input (or it will freeze)

## Default Configuration

Show build details including default configuration path.
* `openssl version -a`
