# Wake On LAN

Remotely managing user devices on a network might require waking up the hardware if it is sleeping.

## Cisco IOS Commands

* `access-session control-direction in`
  * Allow magic packet on port when 802.1x or MAB port authentication are in use.
* `ip directed-broadcast ACCESS-LIST`
  * Configure on Layer Three Switch Vlan Interface (SVI) of sleeping device.
  * Use an Access-List to restrict magic packet source IP to authorized server(s).
* `ip helper-address DIRECTED-BROADCAST-IP`
  * Configure on SVI where Server sends Non-Directed-Broadcast
* `ip forward-protocol udp PORT-NUMBER`
  * Likely UDP port 7 or 9, depends on WoL sender
