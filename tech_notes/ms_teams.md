# MS Teams Notes

## Sharing Files in Group Chat

If you have an impromptu Teams chat group (not a full 365 group and not a full "Team"), 
sharing files uses your individual onedrive rather than a shared group or team folder.

* If a member of your chat group is no longer a valid Teams user, you will get the error "/!\ Failed to send" with a "Retry" option.
  * You must remove this invalid user from the chat group user-list before sharing files will succeed
  * It appears that Teams is trying and failing to grant permission to the invalid user causing the operation to crash.
