# Rack Power

## NEMA Sockets and Plugs

For rack power, we often see Non-locking 5-15P/R, 5-20P/R and Twist-Locking L5-20R/P, L5-30R/P, L6-20R/P, L6-30R/P. The twist-lock connectors are usually input for an UPS or PDU. 
Ironically, the "locking" connectors don't actually lock - they just resist unplugging when twisted to the "locked" position. The twisting motion is unrestrained, and the plug can easily untwist with a light touch.
