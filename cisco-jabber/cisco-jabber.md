## Screen Share

* [Planning Guide for Cisco Jabber 14.0 - Screen Share ][2]
  * Confusing due to multiple types.
  * Four types of screen share:
    * Cisco Webex share
      * For cloud deployments, Webex Screen Share is selected automatically after choosing a contact, if BFCP and IM Only screen share options are not available.
    * BFCP share
      * Remote screen control is not supported with BFCP
      * Video desktop sharing using BFCP is not supported if Trusted Relay Point or Media Termination Point are enabled on the software phone device. 
      * In Jabber for Windows, the Screen Share button starts a BFCP screen share by default. If BFCP-based sharing is unavailable, the button starts an IM-only screen share if possible.
    * IM Only share
      * One-to-one client-to-client screen share over Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). 
      * Allowed via the EnableP2PDesktopShare parameter
      * IM-only screen share default port range is 49152â€“65535 TCP and UDP
    * Escalate to a meeting and share
      * Use Webex instead of Jabber Screen Sharing
