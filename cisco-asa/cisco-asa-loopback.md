# Cisco ASA Loopback

In version 9.18(2) a Loopback Interface feature was added to better support BGP and management traffic (SSH, RADIUS/TACACS, etc).

See the [ASA 9.18(x) Release Notes][asa918rn] for more detail.

ASA 5512 supports only up to version 9.12.x - loopback won't be available on that hardware.
