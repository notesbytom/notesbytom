# Cisco ASA Access-Lists

## Comments / Remarks

From: ASDM Book 2: Cisco ASA Series Firewall [ASDM Configuration Guide, 7.2 - Chapter: Access Rules][1]

*Using Remarks:
In the ASDM access rule window, a remark that displays next to the rule is the one that was configured before the rule, 
so when you configure a remark from the CLI and then view it in an ASDM access rule window, 
the remark displays next to the rule that was configured after the remark in the CLI. 
However, the packet tracer in ASDM matches the remark that is configured after the matching rule in the CLI.*

I think the access-rule screen is a more important place for comments than the ASDM packet-tracer. 
It is probably best to place comments/remarks BEFORE the associated rule.
